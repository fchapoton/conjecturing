{"name":"Conjecturing","tagline":"","body":"### Conjecturing for Sage\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the code described in the paper Automated Conjecture-making: Fajtlowicz's Dalmatian Heuristic Revisited.\r\n\r\n### Quickstart\r\n\r\nSee the directory `spkg` for instructions on how to build and install a Sage package containing the expressions program.\r\nOnce you have built and installed such a Sage package, you can use the Python files in the directory `sage` to interact\r\nwith the package.\r\n\r\nOpen the directory `sage` in a terminal window and start Sage. Usually this is done using the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sage\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce Sage has started, you can load the file `conjecturing.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsage: attach('conjecturing.py')\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also choose to load any of the other files, but this is not necessary.\r\n\r\nAn example run might look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsage: attach('conjecturing.py')\r\nsage: attach('numbertheory.py')\r\nsage: objects = [5, 10]\r\nsage: conjecture(objects, invariants, 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that loading the file `numbertheory.py` sets the variable `invariants` to a list of invariants used in number theory.\r\n\r\n### Layout of the repository\r\n\r\nThe repository contains four directory:\r\n* `c`: this directory contains the code for the program expressions which is used to generate the expressions and conjectures. This program can also be used as a stand-alone program.\r\n* `spkg`: this directory contains the script needed to construct a Sage package of the C program, so that the program can easily be installed.\r\n* `sage`: this directory contains the Python scripts which integrate the C program into Sage.\r\n* `examples`: this directory contains several examples of how the code in this repository can be used.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n### Tips\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
